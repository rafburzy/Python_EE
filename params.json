I launched it to publish my learnings how to use Python and iPython notebooks for solution of common electrical engineering problems dicussed at electrial engineering courses at universities.\r\n\r\nSo far there are two examples loaded:\r\n- Influence of voltage closing angle on the current peak in an R-L circuit during closing of the circuit.\r\n- Excitation used in seismic testing of electrical equipment.\r\n\r\nTest of entering the code to the site\r\n```html\r\n<h2>Example of code</h2>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"block two first\">\r\n            <h2>Your title</h2>\r\n            <div class=\"wrap\">\r\n            //Your content\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</pre>\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
