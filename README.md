Python_EE
=========

Repository for my IPython projects for topics related to electrical engineering.

The folders in this repository are holding files for the following examples:
<ul>
<li><b>Closing angle</b> - showing influence which the moment of closing an RL circuit has on the transient current in the circuit.</li>
<li><b>RL_and_RLC_circuit</b> - using numerical solution of the differential equations governing the RL and RLC circuits.</li>
<li><b>Seismic</b> - the first notebook I have created showing time-history excitation during a seismic test of electrical equipment.</li>
<li><b>Skin_Proximity_effect</b> - showing formulas for current density of simple cases.</li>
<li><b>Visualizations</b> - trials with possibilities that Bokeh gives.</li>
</ul>
